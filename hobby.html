    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    
    <p>
        During the week I am busy with work and school. 
        However, I take Saturday off from work and school related work. 
        I wake up around 6:00 am in the morning sometimes earlier, to do my weekly hike.
         There is a group/ organization called 510 Hiker in Oakland, CA. that hikes every Saturday morning for about 8 to 12 miles.
          I am part of the group and do my hiking in different parts of the Bay Area for about three hours on average. 
          That is one of my hobbies that I take seriously and consider to be part of my self-care routine. 
          It is also my time to disconnect from the city life that is always on the run and connect with nature. 
          I find nature’s adventure and exploration of different trials rejuvenating my soul. 
          It is where I detox and therapeutic from the week’s workload.

         <p> Sometimes, I hike using <a href="https://bahiker.com/" target="_blank"><i><b>Bay Area Hiker</b></i></a> guidelines and past trials and information. 
                It is a website that has a detailed information on hikes and trails.
