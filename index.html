    <h1>Asmayt Zeru Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my Portfolio!</p> 
        <p>My name is Asmayt Zeru. I am an aspiring Software Engineer.
        Currently, I am in my first semester of graduate school at the University of Boston, studying Software Development. 
        I am currently taking Data Structure and Algorithm, Web Development, and System Analysis classes. 
        I am also working part time at Union Bank and doing full time school, as well as looking for internships for next semester. 
         </p>
      
        <p>In the past, I attended University of Louisville for my undergraduate, and majored in Computer Information System and System Security with a minor in Middle East and Islamic Studies from 2016 â€“ May 2021. 
            While completing my undergrad, I did two internships with a nonprofit organization; 
            one was for a South Africa based in Cape Town and the other was based in Louisville, KY. 
            I participated in a group work building chrome extension and using JOGOT to organize and leverage data from social media. 
            I also studied aboard to study Arabic Fusha (the Standard Arabic) and Darjia (Moroccan and North African Arabic dialect, which is a combination of Arabic, Spanish, French, Tamazight, and Sahrawi.). 
            In addition to studying Software Engineering, I am also passionate about learning new languages, culture, and places; thus, I am fluent in English, Tigrinya, intermediate in Arabic, and conversational Amharic.
